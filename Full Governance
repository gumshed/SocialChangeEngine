## **<p align="center">1. Social Change Engine Breakdown**

**<p align="center">1.    -Sphere Creates Initiative-**
The community within the sphere has created a proposal for the community.  This proposal, while presented in a specific format, is not subject to any other requirements as to content.

**<p align="center">2.    -Community Proposal Review-**

**<p align="center">8a.  -Bounties Assigned-**
Bounties created by the Machine are assigned to the badge voting community member who voted in favor.  The community member now has a second opportunity to accept or reject their badge voting contribution. This allows for voter's remorse due to unrealized previous obligations. Accepting now signs the bounty smart contract, payable upon project completion.

**<p align="center">8b.  -Development Portal Created-**
A Slackroom type development platform will be created from a general template linked to the developmental needs stated in the Sphere Initiative's resource requirements.

**<p align="center">9.  -Development Team Assembled-**

## **<p align="center">2. COMMUNITY VISION**

Open to all, The Movement Community will encourage social change through decentralized collaboration and creation. Social Change doesn't necessarily mean "Social Change". Societal Change is happening. The way people work is changing and the Social Change Engine will be there to provide a platform for the digital revolution.

The Community will vote on and contribute to initiatives brought forth by Spheres within The Movement. 

Community members will have the ability to create user profiles. These profiles allow the system the ability to recognize a permissions-based badge voter system. These badges will allow for members of the community to pledge their skills and talents to an initiative they feel passionate about. Upon profile creation, all members will receive their first support badge. 

Within the Community, members will have the option of testing for Badges.  All tests will be created by a specialist in a given field within the community. 

### **<p align="center">Possible Contribution Badges**

**<p align="center">-Development-**
**<p align="center">-Graphic Design-**
**<p align="center">-Writer-**

These badges can also be used to identify specific attributes of the community member. For example, Community Founders, Ambassadors or Donators within The Movement.  This list will be expandable depending on the needs of The Movement and The Sphere Initiatives. Badges fill permissioned rolls in the voting platform. The badges you have will allow you to contribute to specific needs of a Sphere Initiative.  

## **<p align="center">3. SPHERE INITIATIVE**

Spheres exist within The Movement while focusing on a specific topic that brings the community members together. The focus itself is irrelevant to the whole.  The Sphere has the ability to present their ideas to The Movement via the Sphere Initiative.  The Initiative can represent anything from a Twitter Campaign to a full-on, geopolitical movement combating climate change.  The possibilities are endless and due to the structure of The Movement, exponentially expandable. 


## **<p align="center">4. SPHERE INITIATIVE FORMAT**

**Sphere Initiative Name:**  Title of the Initiative. Must represent the Initiative as a whole. 

**Mission Statement:** A detailed and executable plan to achieve the desired outcome. 

**Required Resources:** Exact specified resources needed to complete Initiative. 

**Offering:**  Bounty Program - Ranging from 0.5 MVT to Infinity (Funds must be available at the time of submittal) 

**Voting Length:** Initiative specific voting timeframe. Ranging from 24 hrs. to 7 days. 


## **<p align="center">5. VOTING PRACTICES AND RULES**

<p align="center">-Voting Majority Wins

<p align="center">-Abstaining is Always an Option

<p align="center">-Voting NO means that you disagree with the proposal in any way due to the content or direction.

<p align="center">-Voting YES means that you have read the proposal and agree with the content and or the direction.

<p align="center">-Depending on what skills/contributions the community member has decided to test into, their UI will reflect those choices by displaying their badges.

<p align="center">-During a YES vote, a single Badge can be associated with a requirement of the initiative.

<p align="center">-Badge Votes are a commitment to participate in the development of the initiative within your chosen field.

<p align="center">-Once the developmental requirements are met through badge voter pledges, the voting timeframe will run out and the result is still up to the community's response.

## **<p align="center">6. FUNDS**

<p align="center">-Submitting a Sphere Initiative locks the funds proposed in the Offering.

<p align="center">-Funds will remain locked for the duration of the community review and community vote.

<p align="center">-After the community review period, the creating sphere has a period of 12 hrs. to commit their proposal to a community vote.

<p align="center">-Failure to the proposal to vote will deposit funds into a community fund.

<p align="center">-Upon the outcome of the vote, the locked funds will then be deposited into either a generated development wallet within the machine or, returned to the creating sphere.


## **<p align="center">7. WALLET AND USER INTERFACE**

The UI will act as a portal to The Movement. The community review and voting on of purposed initiatives, as well as community communication will be possible. 

A simple design tailored to ease of access for the voting community. The community member will have the ability to manage their MVT funds while reviewing upcoming, current, and archived proposals. 

The community member will also be able to update profile information as well as manage their voting badges.  

As a fully functioning wallet, secure MVT transactions will be paramount as well as access to full transaction history. Holding MVT Tokens in the wallet will give the user the ability to vote on the approved initiative.


## **<p align="center">8. Small Scale Scenario.**
    
A 2-5 person sphere creates a proposal and submits their proposal to the community.  The proposal will go through a review process.  The proposal was for a website to be built. The offering was 15 MVT.  There were a few messages exchanged back and forth about the request from the community.  The Proposal is sent to the community for a vote.  The Voting clock will begin.  Once the clock runs out the proposal is analyzed to see if the request had been accepted. Proposal moves to the development stage.  The voter who accepted the request now completes the website. Final Project submitted for Approval.  Once Approved, Payment is delivered, and the sphere takes control of the website. 


## **<p align="center">9. Mid-Scale Scenario**

No Name Human Rights Activist Sphere with 5,000 members creates a proposal.  The request is basic but requires a lot of resources. The sphere was able to raise an 8,000 MVT Offering (divide up per person per requirement spot). Their proposal is submitted for review.  Interested members of the community join the discussion. Planning on execution and teams happen within the community. Proposals are then sent to vote and the clock starts. Members of the community who believe in this project will vote and pledge their contributions via their badges. The project called for 4 graphic designers, 2 web developers, 1 printing shop with shipping capabilities, 40-person street team, and 2 social media consultants. Members of the community filled the required badge votes and the YES votes continued to pile in from the community.  Proposal enters development phase. The Development Team does whatever work was agreed upon. Once completed, finish product is approved and deliver to the sphere with bounties paid. 


## **<p align="center">10. Large Scale Scenario**

At this point, we are talking about a complete paradigm shift in the way people "work" and create value. This is the Social Change Engine's end goal. Social Change doesn't necessarily mean "Social Change". Society itself is changing. With new and emerging technologies, the future is many regards is uncertain. Society's working populations may need to evolve. Creating an entirely new virtual economy that provides financial and creative freedom to all who participate in the Social Change Engine's Mission. 

## **<p align="center">11. Possible Future**

For managing and recording truth, all completed initiative information could be stored on the MVT Blockchain.
